I scanned the ports of another machine's private IP on my network and recorded the runtime using the single threaded version versus the multi threaded example that is using 10 threads.

java -jar PortScanner.jar 172.16.0.4 1 65535


Connected to port 5000 with local address 55730/172.16.0.13
Connected to port 7000 with local address 46984/172.16.0.13
Connected to port 49241 with local address 50756/172.16.0.13

Total Runtime: 4 minutes 22 seconds


java -jar ThreadedPortScanner.jar 172.16.0.4 1 65535

Connected to port 7000 with local address 43758/172.16.0.13
Connected to port 49241 with local address 39590/172.16.0.13
Connected to port 5000 with local address 42954/172.16.0.13

Total Runtime: 1 minute and 50 seconds

Slightly more than twice as fast using 10 threads.
